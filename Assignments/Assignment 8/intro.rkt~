;; (keep-ints lon) consumes a list (denoted by "lon")
;; to produce a list of the integers in lon
;; keep-ints: (listof Any) -> (listof Int)
;; Examples:
(check-expect (keep-ints empty) empty)
(check-expect (keep-ints (cons â€™a (cons 1 (cons "b" (cons 2 empty)))))
              (cons 1 (cons 2 empty)))
